"{\"Judgement\":True,\"Reason\":\"Gary is young and round, therefore he is quiet based on 'All round, young people are quiet.' He is also big because 'Young people are big.' From 'All quiet, big people are smart,' it follows that Gary, being quiet and big, is smart.\"}"

"{\"Judgement\":True,\"Reason\":\"From Premise 1, Charlie is young. Premise 3 states Charlie is green. Premise 13 concludes that all young, green things are cold, thus Charlie is cold. Premise 10 specifies that all cold, young things are kind, thereby concluding Charlie is kind.\"}"

"{\"Judgement\":True,\"Reason\":\"From the premises stating Erin is green and nice, and using the conditional premise that if something is green and nice then it is kind, it logically follows that Erin is kind.\"}"
"{\"Judgement\":True,\"Reason\":\"From the premise 'If something is quiet then it is young' and the fact that 'Fiona is quiet', by modus ponens, it follows that Fiona is young.\"}"
"{\"Judgement\":True,\"Reason\":\"Given that Erin is both quiet (Q(E)) and young (Y(E)), and the premise '(Q(x) and Y(x)) implies F(x)' states that all quiet, young people are furry, it logically follows that Erin is furry (F(E)).\"}"
"{\"Judgement\":True,\"Reason\":\"Fiona is both big and green, which by Premise 7 implies Fiona is young. Since Fiona is young and green, and all young, green things are furry according to Premise 5, Fiona is furry.\"}"
