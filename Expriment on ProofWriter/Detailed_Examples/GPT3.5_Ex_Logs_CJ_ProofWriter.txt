"Based on the premises given, we can use First-Order Logic to determine whether the hypothesis \"Anne is round\" is true.\n\nLet's define the following predicates:\nR(x): x is rough\nK(x): x is kind\nG(x): x is green\nY(x): x is young\nQ(x): x is quiet\nB(x): x is blue\nZ(x): x is round\n\nThe premises can be translated into logical statements as follows:\n\n1.
