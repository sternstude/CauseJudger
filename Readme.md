# CauseJudger

### Introduction

Work for AAAI 2025.

**CauseJudger (CJ)** is a new framework for **LLMs abductive reasoning**, which determines the authenticity of possible cause by transforming thinking from reverse to forward and removing irrelevant information.

**CauseLogics** is an abductive logical reasoning decision dataset, which contains tasks of varying reasoning lengths.

The CauseLogics Dataset and experimental results of CauseJudger are now publicly available. The code will be released after the acceptance of our work.
