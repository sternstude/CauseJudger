"To determine whether the \"Hypothesis\" (Justin is beautiful) is true, we'll use First-Order Logic to analyze the given \u201cPremises\u201d. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n### Premises:\n\n1. Justin is happy \\( H(j) \\)\n2. Justin is enthusiastic \\( E(j) \\)\n3. Justin is angry \\( A(j) \\)\n4. Paul is angry \\( A(p) \\)\n5. If a person is creative then this person is patient \\( (\\forall x)(C(x) \\rightarrow P(x)) \\)\n6. If a person is trustworthy and outgoing then this person is patient \\( (\\forall x)((T(x) \\land O(x)) \\rightarrow P(x)) \\)\n7. If a person is lazy then this person is beautiful \\( (\\forall x)(L(x) \\rightarrow B(x)) \\)\n8. If a person is creative and creative then this person is patient \\( (\\forall x)((C(x) \\land C(x)) \\rightarrow P(x)) \\)\n9. If a person is enthusiastic and happy then this person is lazy \\( (\\forall x)((E(x) \\land H(x)) \\rightarrow L(x)) \\)\n10. If a person is trustworthy then this person is patient \\( (\\forall x)(T(x) \\rightarrow P(x)) \\)\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- Justin is beautiful \\( B(j) \\)\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nWe need to ascertain if the hypothesis \\( B(j) \\) can be logically deduced from the given premises.\n\n1. **Premises** 1 and 2 tell us that Justin is both happy and enthusiastic:\n    \\[\n    H(j) \\land E(j)\n    \\]\n\n2. **Premise 9** states that if a person is enthusiastic and happy, then this person is lazy:\n    \\[\n    (\\forall x)((E(x) \\land H(x)) \\rightarrow L(x))\n    \\]\n\n3. Since Justin is enthusiastic and happy, according to premise 9, Justin must be lazy:\n    \\[\n    (E(j) \\land H(j)) \\rightarrow L(j) \\rightarrow \\text{Lazy}(j) \\text{, i.e., } L(j)\n    \\]\n\n4. **Premise 7** specifies that if a person is lazy, then this person is beautiful:\n    \\[\n    (\\forall x)(L(x) \\rightarrow B(x))\n    \\]\n\n5. Since we have already established that Justin is lazy, by premise 7:\n    \\[\n    L(j) \\rightarrow B(j) \\text{, i.e., } \\text{Lazy}(j) \\rightarrow B(j)\n    \\]\n\nThus, \\( L(j) \\) holds, and therefore:\n    \\[\n    B(j)\n    \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the premises and the logical deductions we have made, the hypothesis \\( \\text{Justin is beautiful} \\) is indeed TRUE."

"To determine if the hypothesis \"Justin is beautiful\" is true, we need to follow a structured approach using First-Order Logic and the given premises.\n\nFirst, let's list what we know from the premises:\n1. Justin is happy. (P1)\n2. Justin is enthusiastic. (P2)\n3. Justin is angry. (P3)\n4. Paul is angry. (P4)\n5. If a person is creative then this person is patient. (P5)\n6. If a person is trustworthy and outgoing then this person is patient. (P6)\n7. If a person is lazy then this person is beautiful. (P7)\n8.
