"To determine whether the hypothesis \"Anne is trustworthy\" is true based on the given premises, we can represent the premises and the hypothesis in First-Order Logic (FOL) and then apply logical deduction:\n\nLet:\nE(x) = x is excited\nR(x) = x is responsible\nL(x) = x is lazy\nH(x) = x is humorous\nT(x) = x is trustworthy\nN(x) = x is loyal\nO(x) = x is honest\nS(x) = x is shy\nI(x) = x is intelligent\n\nPremises:\n1. E(Anne)\n2. R(Anne)\n3.

T(Anne)\n\nBased on the premises and the hypothesis, we can analyze:\nBased on premise 5, since Anne is responsible and excited, she is trustworthy. Therefore, the hypothesis \"Anne is trustworthy\" is true based on the given premises."

"Based on the given premises, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Lucy is mature\n- Lucy is honest\n- If a person is honest and mature then this person is wise\n\nFrom the above premises, we can conclude that Lucy is wise. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. (Lucy is mature) \u2227 (Lucy is honest)   (Given premises)\n2. (Lucy is honest) \u2227 (Lucy is mature) \u2192 (Lucy is wise)   (Given premises)\n3. Therefore, Lucy is wise\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis \"Lucy is wise\" is TRUE based on the given premises and applying First-Order Logic."

"Based on the premises given, there is no direct evidence or logical inference that can conclude that Jessica is lazy. The premises only mention Jessica's responsibility, wisdom, creativity, and do not provide any information about her being lazy. Therefore, the hypothesis that \"Jessica is lazy\" cannot be determined as true based on the given premises using First-Order Logic."

"To determine whether the hypothesis \"Justin is honest\" is true based on the given premises, we need to analyze each premise:\n\n1. \"Justin is creative\"\n2. \"Justin is calm\"\n3. \"Justin is intelligent\"\n4. \"If a person is calm and creative then this person is honest\"\n\nBased on the premises, it is not explicitly stated that being creative, calm, and intelligent makes someone honest. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Justin is honest based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, we cannot definitively say that Justin is honest."

"To determine if the hypothesis \"Lucy is confident\" is true based on the given premises, we need to follow the logical implications provided.\n\n1. If a person is beautiful and quiet then this person is confident.\n\nGiven: \n- Lucy is beautiful (Premise)\n- Lucy is quiet (Premise)\n\nBased on the given premises:\n- If a person is beautiful and quiet then this person is confident.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises given, we can conclude that the hypothesis \"Lucy is confident\" is true."

"To determine whether the hypothesis \"Peter is humorous\" is true based on the given premises, we need to analyze the statements using First-Order Logic (FOL):\n\nLet:\nR(x) = x is responsible\nQ(x) = x is quiet\nW(x) = x is wise\nB(x) = x is brave\nP(x) = x is patient\nE(x) = x is enthusiastic\nZ(x) = x is positive\nH(x) = x is humorous\n\nThe premises can be translated into FOL as follows:\n1. R(Peter)\n2. Q(Peter)\n3. W(Peter)\n4. \u2200x (B(x) \u2227 P(x) \u2192 E(x))\n5. \u2200x (P(x) \u2192 Z(x))\n6. \u2200x (E(x) \u2227 P(x) \u2192 E(x))\n7. \u2200x (P(x) \u2192 E(x))\n8. \u2200x (Q(x) \u2227 R(x) \u2192 H(x))\n\nNow, we need to deduce whether Peter is humorous based on the premises. From premise 8, we can see that if Peter is quiet and responsible (Q(Peter) \u2227 R(Peter)), then he is humorous (H(Peter)). Since we know from premise 1 and premise 2 that Peter is responsible and quiet, we can conclude that Peter is indeed humorous based on the premises.\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis \"Peter is humorous\" is true based on the given premises and using First-Order Logic."

"Based on the given premises, we can infer the following:\n\n1. Helen is responsible\n2. Helen is mature\n3. Helen is creative\n4. If a person is mature and responsible then this person is humorous\n\nFrom premise 4, we can see that if a person is mature and responsible, then they are humorous. Since Helen is both mature and responsible, we can conclude that Helen is humorous.\n\nTherefore, the hypothesis \"Helen is humorous\" is true based on the given premises."

"Based on the given premises, we can break down the information and apply First-Order Logic to determine if the hypothesis \"Ted is shy\" is true.\n\n1. Ted is calm - Given\n2. Ted is angry - Given\n3. Ted is outgoing - Given\n\nFrom premise 4: \"If a person is intelligent and confident then this person is nervous.\"\n- Ted is angry and calm, but there is no information given about his intelligence or confidence. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about Ted being nervous.\n\nFrom premise 5: \"If a person is loyal then this person is confident.\"\n- There is no information given about Ted being loyal, so we cannot determine his level of confidence.\n\nFrom premise 6: \"If a person is angry and calm then this person is shy.\"\n- Ted meets the conditions of being both angry and calm, so based on this premise, Ted could be considered shy.\n\nFrom premise 7: \"If a person is intelligent then this person is nervous.\"\n- There is no information given about Ted being intelligent, so we cannot determine if he is nervous based on this premise.\n\nFrom premise 8: \"If a person is intelligent and confident then this person is confident.\"\n- This premise does not provide any new information that can help us determine whether Ted is shy.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can conclude that there is not enough evidence to definitively say whether the hypothesis \"Ted is shy\" is true or false."

"Based on the given premises, we can conclude the following:\n\n1. Lucy is patient (Given)\n2. Lucy is humorous (Given)\n3. Lucy is excited (Given)\n4. If a person is patient and humorous then this person is angry (From premise: \"If a person is patient and humorous then this person is angry\")\n\nFrom premises 1, 2, and 4, we can deduce that Lucy is angry based on First-Order Logic reasoning.
